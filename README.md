# step_assignment1 : anagram

## Methods

I tried two ways to solve the problem.  
Both of the methods sorted the word in the order of alphabet.  
The first method(anagram.ipynb) using binary serach to find out if the word is in the dictionary.  
The second method(anagram_hashtable) using the python built-in fuction:dict, using hash.

## Result

I got 41 results(total scores) from the "Icanhazwordz" game and then caculated them.  

Mean 1362.85;  
StandardDeviation 209.168;  
Skewness -0.00421883;  ほぼ対称である。分布はやや緩尖的分布である。  
Kurtosis 2.69986;  分布の鋭さは尖な分布である。

From the above number, we can know that the most common score is between 1200-1600. If we want to get a score over 1800, usually we need to try more than 40 times.
(Of course since I only tested 40 times, the number is uncertain)
